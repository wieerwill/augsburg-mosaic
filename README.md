## Project Overview

Augsburg Mosaic serves as a digital guide, offering a curated list of places categorized as Attractions, Food spots, Cultural hubs, Nature retreats, and Others. Through an interactive map and a user-friendly list, one can explore, filter, and learn more about each location.

Utilizing technologies such as Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Leaflet.js for map rendering, and Pinia for state management, this project embodies a seamless blend of design and functionality, all while being a purely static site optimized for SEO. This also means, there are no cookies or any other data collection mechanisms involved, especially not concerning personal data.

This endeavor is purely a hobby, unfunded yet rich in spirit. The icons embellishing this site are courtesy of FontAwesome, while the images are captured through the lens of [WieErWill](https://wieerwill.de).
